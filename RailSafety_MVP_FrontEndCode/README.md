Notes:
to speed up the application development process and for rapid prototyping, used the github package Vuetify-md-pro-clone as base template/layer. The UI was further customized/ tweaked and added the needed functionality to bind the Vuejs functions and invoke the server side code with REST APIs for various CRUD operations.
