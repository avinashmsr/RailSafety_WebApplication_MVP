# RailSafety_WebApplication_MVP
I developed this Full stack web Application MVP for a rail safety project that would be integrated with other web applications.
I used VueJS as the Front end, and for the Back end, used Python Django framework with REST APIs to perform various CRUD operations(Request and Response payload format JSON) and PostgreSQL as the Database engine.
I chose Python as the programming language and Django framework do rapid prototyping and develop the MVP with a quick turn around time.
